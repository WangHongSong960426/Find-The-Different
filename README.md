# Find-The-Different and data-analysis

I put the two projects in the same folder, so I put Find-The-Different and data analysis into the same repository.
Find-The-Different: Learning to use tkinter.
data-analysis: Python code calculates the mean, sum of squares of deviations, variance, and correlation coefficient.
